Prologue

HBVM has been designed for Image Generator since 2007. A scripting system was required to
replace the hard-coded Host-to-IG interface module. Interface module implementers can now
easily re-code the script and run it as desired without the compilation and build process.
HBVM scripts can be programmed. It also shares variables, functions, and structures and
interacts with host applications using events. HBVM can control host applications and vice versa
(two-way operation).
The VM after the abbreviation HB stands for the virtual machine you know. Therefore, object
code is generated internally rather than compiled. And object code can be disassembled.
Object code can also be generated in binary format and used by HBVM.
